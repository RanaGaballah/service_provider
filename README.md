# Service Providers Software Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Service Providers Software Project! This project aims to develop a robust software solution for managing service providers. In this project, we have implemented the SOLID principles, the Strategy pattern, and the Decorator design pattern. We have built an API for each function using the Spring framework and Java, which can be tested using Postman.

## Features
1. Service Provider Management: The software allows you to create, read, update, and delete service providers. It provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to manage service provider information efficiently.

2. SOLID Principles: We have applied the SOLID principles throughout the project. These principles ensure that the software is maintainable, scalable, and robust. We have designed the codebase to be modular, flexible, and easily extensible.

3. Strategy Design Pattern: The Strategy design pattern is employed to handle different service provider types effectively. It allows us to encapsulate various algorithms and behaviors and dynamically select them at runtime.

4. Decorator Design Pattern: The Decorator design pattern is utilized to enhance the functionality of service providers. We can add additional features and behaviors dynamically without modifying the existing code.

5. API using Spring and Java: Each function in the software is exposed through a RESTful API developed using the Spring framework and Java. This ensures a scalable and efficient architecture for handling service provider operations.

## Installation
To install and set up the Service Providers Software Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Ensure that you have Java and Maven installed.
4. Configure the database connection settings in the `application.properties` file.
5. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
6. Start the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`

## Usage
Once the installation process is complete, you can start using the Service Providers Software. Here are the basic steps to get started:

1. Access the software using a web browser or any API testing tool such as Postman.
2. Use the API endpoints to perform various operations on service providers:
   - Create a new service provider by sending a `POST` request to `/providers` with the required information.
   - Retrieve a list of existing service providers by sending a `GET` request to `/providers`.
   - View the details of a specific service provider by sending a `GET` request to `/providers/{id}`.
   - Update the information of a service provider by sending a `PUT` request to `/providers/{id}` with the updated data.
   - Delete a service provider by sending a `DELETE` request to `/providers/{id}`.

You can also explore additional features and functionalities provided by the software.

## API Documentation
The Service Providers Software exposes the following API endpoints:

1. `GET /providers`: Retrieves a list of all service providers.
2. `GET /providers/{id}`: Retrieves the details of a specific service provider.
3. `POST /providers`: Creates a new service provider.
4. `PUT /providers/{id}`: Updates the information of a service provider.
5. `DELETE /providers/{id}`: Deletes a service provider.

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on request formats, response codes, and available parameters.
